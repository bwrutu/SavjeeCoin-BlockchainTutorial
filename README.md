# SavjeeCoin-BlockchainTutorial
This was a tutorial for Savjee Coin, a blockchain tutorial video on YouTube.

The intention for this project is to turn it into a website that people can interact with and demonstrate even better how blockchain can work in a very simple example.
The website will be considered complete if:
- It's hosted on a server
- A user can set the difficulty (without breaking the website)
- A user can see how mining the block works
- A user can see how they recieve coins
